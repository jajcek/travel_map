                    I have developed software professionally for 10 years by using various technologies
                    in areas like frontend, backend or pure desktop applications. However, I got into these topics when I was 15 and
                    since then I have been experimenting with other areas like mobile technologies (Android), game development (DirectX), compilers (Flex&Bison).
                    Today, my main technology stack stays around Java and JavaScript letting me become a full stack developer.
                    I have experience with e.g. Spring, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, AWS.
                    Apart from programming I played a lot with graphics, especially 3D in 3Ds Max / Blender.

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2013 I have graduated BSc from Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology in Computer Science at PPT faculty with the thesis:
                    "Automating and scheduling work in a system" which can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7x6g4c3-UJfQzZtTXU1M1NMRDg">here</a> (in polish).
                    In 2015 I have graduated MSc with the thesis: "Dynamic generation of an infinite area in virtual 3D space" which
                    is <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7x6g4c3-UJfV2NwbkE0MVhPY1E">here</a> (in english).
                    At the studies I won a compiler contest which required students to implement a compiler (using Flex & Bison)
                    for a toy-language (given by the lecturer) that produces the "fastest" bytecode.

                    <p>
                        I have been doing sport rock climbing for 5 years and from time to time I take it as seriously as software engineering.
                        I am also a certified scuba diver and have dived in several places like Egypt, Spain, Croatia, Thailand, Cyprus.
                        Recently I've started travelling more and more and that's why I have create my own private project available in the Travel menu.
